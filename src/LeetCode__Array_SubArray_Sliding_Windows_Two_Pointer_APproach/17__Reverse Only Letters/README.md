we have to take 2 pointer i from left and j from right
we have to check is the found character is english small or capital letter if yes then we need to swap
if not then we just need to either increment left pointer or decrement right pointer so that
the non-alphabetic letter will be at the same position

Time Complexity = O(n)
Space Complexity = O(n) , because we have taken an array
