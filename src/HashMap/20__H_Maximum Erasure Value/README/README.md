you have to find unique subarray whose sum of elements should be maximum and delete that subarray elements from the given
array.

# Approach - we are going to use sliding window

Time complexity - O(n) if we are using set contains or remove then O(1)
Space Complexity - O(m) where m is number of unique elements
